** Consonant inventory
| p     | t        | k      | q     | ʔ |
| b [β] |          | g [ɣ]  |       |   |
|       | c [t͡s] |        |       |   |

** Vowel inventory
| <c> | <c> | <c> |
|  i  |     |  u  |
|     | (ə) |     |
|     |  a  |     |

** Schwa
- The vowel [ə] is quasi-phonemic.
  - It cannot be stressed.
  - It appears only in the first syllable.

** Stress
is always word-final.

** Matu'uwal morphology
- As most other Formosan languages, Atayal has a rich affixation system:
  - Suffixes: /-un/ (Patient Voice), /-an/ (Locative Voice),
  - Prefixes: /si-/ (Circumstantial Voice), /pa-/ (future or causative),
  - Infixes: /<um>/ (Actor Voice), /<in>/ (perfective),
  - Reduplication: /Ca-/ (future, nominalization), /CVC-/ (plurality).

** Affixation examples
Root \text{/capuh/} 'to sweep'
- /c\textbf{um}apuh/ 'to sweep [AV]'
- /capuh\textbf{an}/ 'to sweep [LV]'
- /\textbf{ca}capuh/ 'broom'

** Root shapes
- The canonical root shape in many Austronesian languages is CVCVC.
- There can be longer and shorter roots, some of which we will see today.

* Synchronic vowel alternations
** Three main processes
- Historical schwa alternations
- Hiatus resolution
- Rhythmic vowel reduction

** Historical schwa alternations :animate:nohandout:
** Historical schwa alternations :animate:
- As the name suggests, these alternations arose due to changes of historical *ə.
- *ə underwent different changes depending on its position in the word.

** Historical schwa alternations
- These alternations are specific to the roots in which they occur.
- I treat these roots as having an underlying \textit{/ə/} phoneme.
  
** Historical schwa alternations
- We can group schwa-alternating roots based on where the underlying \textit{/ə/} occurs:
  - For disyllabic roots, these are /CVCəC/, /CəCVC/, and /CəCəC/.
  
** CVCəC roots
| t<um>ah\textbf{u}k | tahk-un | 'to cook'           |
| ma-bah\textbf{u}q  | bahq-an | 'to wash (clothes)' |
| q<um>ih\textbf{u}l | qihl-un | 'to force, compel'  |
- Compare /c<um>apuh~capuh-an/, with no alternation.

** CəCVC roots
| h<um>raq | h\textbf{a}raq-un | 'to strip off' |
| s<um>kuʔ | s\textbf{u}kuʔ-un | 'to put'       |
| s<um>liʔ | s\textbf{i}liʔ-un | 'to collect'   |

** CəCəC roots
| h<um>g\textbf{u}b | h\textbf{a}gb-an | 'to scry'    |
| k<um>l\textbf{u}h | k\textbf{a}lh-un | 'to harvest' |
| q<um>l\textbf{u}ʔ | q\textbf{a}lʔ-un | 'to close'   |

** Schwa rules
- It makes more sense to write two separate rules for schwa:
  - *ə-deletion* and *ə-fortition*.

** ə-deletion
Delete any [ə] between two syllables.

** ə-deletion
ə → ∅ / VC_CV

** ə-fortition
Fortition [ə] into a cardinal vowel depending on its position.

** ə-fortition
- This is a simplification of a more complex series of rules.
- We are skipping over the details in this talk.

** Schwa rules
- ə-fortition precedes ə-deletion.
  - We will see why later in the talk.

** Schwa rules
|             | \text{/qələʔ + <um>/} | \text{/qələʔ + -un/} |
|-------------+---------------------+--------------------|
| ə-fortition | quməluʔ             | qaləʔun            |
| ə-deletion  | qumluʔ              | qalʔun             |

** Non-alternating vowels :noexport:
| Pre-/infixed form | Suffixed form | Meaning            |
|-------------------+---------------+--------------------|
| t<um>akuʔ         | takuʔ-un      | 'to scoop up'      |
| r<um>aŋaʔ         | raŋaʔ-un      | 'to plead'         |
| ma-puhug          | puhug-un      | 'to break in half' |
- Alternating roots contrast with non-alternating ones.

** Hiatus resolution :animate:nohandout:
** Hiatus resolution :animate:
- *Hiatuses* are heterosyllabic vowel sequences with no intervening consonant.
  - E.g. /kaal [ka.al]/ 'sky'
- Matu'uwal allows hiatuses, but only in the final two syllables.

** Hiatus resolution
- Hiatuses are resolved when they are no longer in the rightmost foot.
- There are two types of hiatuses in Matu'uwal: identical vowels, and \text{/a/} + high vowel.

** Hiatus resolution
Hiatuses are resolved in different ways{{{nl}}}depending on the type:
- Identical vowels *coalesce* into one segment.
- \textit{/a.i, a.u/} undergo *gliding* into monosyllabic \textit{/ay, aw/}.

** Hiatus resolution
| k<um>aal | kal-an | 'to speak, say'    |
| r<um>uuʔ | ruʔ-un | 'to cling to s.o.' |
| h<um>iiʔ | hiʔ-an | 'to pour'          |

** Hiatus resolution
| m-aiq    | bayq-an | 'to give'      |
| c<um>aum | cawm-an | 'to rub, wipe' |
| k<um>aiʔ | kayʔ-an | 'to dig'       |

** Hiatus resolution
- We include both gliding and coalescence into a single rule.
- This combined rule is called *hiatus resolution*.

** Rhythmic vowel reduction :animate:nohandout:
** Rhythmic vowel reduction :animate:
- The fourth-to-last vowel is reduced if it is in the stem [cite:@huang2017a].
  - However, most affixation is untouched.
- Depending on word structure, the reduced vowel becomes /[ə]/ or is deleted.

** Rhythmic vowel reduction
| k<um>\textbf{a}nuhuw  | kənuhu-un               | 'to stir up trouble' |
| s<um>\textbf{i}ʔuwaʔ  | səʔuwaʔ-an              | 'to like, want'      |
| ma-s\textbf{i}quwing  | səquwing-un             | 'to disagree'        |
| si-pak\textbf{a}tiʔ   | paktiʔ-ani              | 'to throw'           |
| m-aks\textbf{i}nguwiʔ | pak\textbf{a}snguwiʔ-un | 'to fall asleep'     |

** Rhythmic vowel reduction
- We can model rhythmic vowel reduction (*RVR*) as just weakening.
- Any deletion is then taken care of by the ə-deletion rule.
  - This way, RVR > ə-deletion.

** Rhythmic vowel reduction
|             | \text{/pakatiʔ + -ani/} |
|-------------+-----------------------|
| ə-fortition | --                    |
| RVR         | pakətiʔani            |
| ə-deletion  | paktiʔani             |

* Interactions between alternation processes
** Interactions
- We can find roots where two of the above processes co-occur.
- This allows us to see how they interact.

** Schwa and RVR
- RVR still applies to roots with an underlying schwa.
- This happens even when the schwa is not present in the SR.

** Schwa and RVR
| m-ayhul    | pihl-an    | 'to tread'      |
| tayhuk     | tihk-an    | 'to arrive'     |
| q<um>aylup | qa-qilp-an | 'to sleep' (f.) |
- c.f. /m-aybul~paybul-an/ 'to get water'

** Schwa and RVR
|             | \text{/taihək/} | \text{/taihək + -an/} |
|-------------+---------------+---------------------|
| ə-fortition | taihuk        | --                  |
| RVR         | --            | təihəkan            |
| ə-deletion  | --            | tihkan              |
| Hiatus res. | tayhuk        | --                  |

** Schwa and RVR
- In the previous table, I cheated by using ə-deletion to remove both schwas in [təihəkan].
- Alternatively, we could leave the first schwa to hiatus resolution.

** Schwa and RVR
| g<um>ilbak  | gəl\textbf{a}bak-an  | 'to tidy up' |
| s<um>ilngaʔ | səl\textbf{a}ngaʔ-an | 'to hurry'   |

** Schwa and RVR
|             | \text{/giləbak + -an/} |
|-------------+----------------------|
| ə-fortition | gilabakan            |
| RVR         | gəlabakan            |
| ə-deletion  | --                   |
| Hiatus res. | --                   |
- ə-fortition > ə-deletion

** Hiatus and RVR
| m-ahiiq | pəhiq-un   | 'to squeeze, pinch' |
| qilaap  | qa-qlap-an | 'to sleep' (m.)     |
| m-ahaag | ba-bhag-un | 'to chase'          |

** Hiatus and RVR
|             | \text{/Ca- + bahaag + -un/} |
|-------------+---------------------------|
| ə-fortition | --                        |
| RVR         | babəhaagun                |
| ə-deletion  | babhaagun                 |
| Hiatus res. | babhagun                  |
- RVR > Hiatus resolution

** Interactions
- In most cases of interaction, the environment for RVR is not present in the SR.
  - These are examples of *counterbleeding opacity*.
- These alternations can be modeled with only a few phonological rules.

* Problematic cases
** Problematic cases
- In general, the rule-based analysis works well.
- In some cases, the current rules predict the wrong results.

** RVR + <um>
- The main problem is avoiding overapplication of RVR in infixes.
- RVR is affected by suffixes, but does not affect infixes and reduplication.
  - Derivational prefixes are sometimes affected.
  
** RVR + <um>
|             | \text{/<um> + giləbak/} | \text{/giləbak + -an/} |
|-------------+-----------------------+----------------------|
| ə-fortition | --                    | gilabakan            |
| RVR         | g\textbf{ə}miləbak    | gəlabakan            |
| ə-deletion  | **gəmilbak            |                      |
| Expected:   | gumilbak              |                      |

** RVR + <in>
- In some instances of <in>-infixation, RVR and ə-deletion do not apply.
- These are due to surface-form restrictions.

** RVR + <in>
Normal behaviour:
| cəʔarx-an  | c<in>ʔarx-an | 'to stand'            |
| pətiqsuʔ   | m<in>tiqsuʔ  | 'to pray for harvest' |
| m-ərakiyas | m<in>rakiyas | 'to grow (intr.)'     |

** RVR + <in>
Exceptions:
| m-ənaquuʔ  | ʔ<in>\textbf{a}naquuʔ  | 'to repair'  |
| m-ənaqruʔ  | ʔ<in>\textbf{a}naqruʔ  | 'to finish'  |
| m-ənaʔaluʔ | ʔ<in>\textbf{a}naʔaluʔ | 'to replace' |

** RVR + <in>
- All of the above exceptions avoid a geminate [nn] in the output.
- This is an example of a *conspiracy*, a problem in rule-based phonology.

** RVR + <in>
|             | \text{/ʔənaqərəʔ + <in>/} |
|-------------+-------------------------|
| ə-fortition | ʔinənaqəruʔ             |
| RVR         | --                      |
| ə-deletion  | ʔinnaqruʔ               |
| Hiatus res. | **ʔinnaqruʔ             |
| Expected:   | ʔin\textbf{a}naqruʔ     |

* Conclusion
** Conclusion
- Matu'uwal data exhibits both opacity and conspiracy.
- It serves as a good demonstration of the strengths and weaknesses of various phonological theories.
